# **Manual Trading Challenge: “Vanilla Just Isn’t Exotic Enough”**

As the Intarian economy evolved, trading expanded beyond standard calls and puts. In this round, you can trade `AETHER_CRYSTAL`, vanilla options with 2 and 3 week expiries, and several exotic derivatives written on the same underlying.

Please note that a ‘week’ here refers to 5 trading days and that the ‘standard’ number of trading days per year is 252 (since some big exchanges are typically open 252 days per year). So “2 weeks” means 10 trading days, and “3 weeks” represents 15 trading days. For transparency purposes, this is how the days are computed on our end:

```python
TRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR = 252
STEPS_PER_DAY = 4
STEPS_PER_YEAR = TRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR * STEPS_PER_DAY

def weeks_to_years(weeks: float) -> float:
    # 5 business days per week, annualized to 252 trading days
    return (weeks * 5) / TRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR

def steps_for_weeks(weeks: float) -> int:
    return int(round(weeks * 5 * STEPS_PER_DAY))
```

Thus, when you see "2 weeks", assume it means `2 * 5 * STEPS_PER_DAY` steps over 10 days.

Your objective is to construct positions that generate positive expected PnL. But be aware: unhedged exposure can lead to large losses, so risk management matters. The PnL is marked to the ‘fair’ value upon expiry, which is the average value of the product across 100 simulations. You should maximize the PnL on the products *as you hold them till expiry if you buy* (and short till expiry if you short). In other words, there is no buying or selling across days. You decide to buy/sell at t=0 (start of round 4) and hold it till expiry, at which point they are marked against their fair value. ***This means this challenge is completely standalone (there is NO relationship to Round 1)***.

All products are written on `AETHER_CRYSTAL`. You can trade the underlying, 2 week and 3 week vanilla calls and puts, and the following exotics:

---

### ❓ **Chooser Option**

Expires in 3 weeks. After 2 weeks, the buyer chooses whether it becomes a call or a put, selecting whichever would be in the money at that time. It then behaves like a standard option for the final week until expiry.

---

### 🔀 **Binary Put Option**

Has an all-or-nothing payoff. If the underlying is below the strike at expiry, it pays the specified amount. Otherwise, it expires worthless.

---

### 🥊 **Knock-Out Put Option**

Behaves like a regular put unless the underlying ever trades below the knockout barrier before expiry. If the barrier is breached at any point, the option immediately becomes worthless.

---

You may buy or sell up to the displayed volume in each product. Note that the “contract size” is 3000 across all products, and is only used as a way to scale PnL proportionally to Rounds 3 and 5; think of it as a PnL multiplier on the PnL you make on the individual products (underlying, options) listed in the table. The prices you see are for each individual option.

Your final score is the average PnL across 100 simulations of the underlying.

The underlying `AETHER_CRYSTAL` is simulated using Geometric Brownian Motion with zero risk-neutral drift and fixed annualized volatility of 251%. Prices evolve on a discrete grid of 4 steps per trading day, assuming 252 trading days per year (see code above). There is no ‘continuous’ modeling under the hood that could trigger a knock-out; you should only consider these discrete points.

And remember, when payoffs become conditional, so does risk. Good luck!

**Note on “price” column**: this is purely cosmetic and should show the ‘investment cost’, but is unrelated to your PnL. It should in no way affect your trading decision, and you can freely ignore it.
